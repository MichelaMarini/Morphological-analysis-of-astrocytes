## **Purpose and Use Case**
Astrocyte image analysis pipeline to automatically extract and analyze single-cell phenotypic profiles of astrocytes in micrographs. 
The pipeline consist of four processing units, i.e., (1) [astrocyte detection](https://github.com/yewen/AstrocyteDetection), (2) [segmentation](https://github.com/zhaoheng001/Segmentation_code/tree/main)
(3) feature extraction and selection, and (4) [morphological and statistical modeling](https://github.com/MichelaMarini/Morphological-analysis-of-astrocytes)
